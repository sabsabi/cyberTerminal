# AISLE Cyber Terminal

A retro-futuristic terminal experience reimagined for **AISLE Partners**.  
This interactive demo showcases our work in **AI automations, RAG chatbots, and enterprise solutions**,  
presented in a cyberpunk-inspired terminal interface.

## 🔎 What It Is
The AISLE Cyber Terminal is a **standalone marketing microsite** that:
- Simulates a command-line interface with typing + glitch effects
- Displays AISLE’s **capabilities, selected work, and contact points**
- Runs fully client-side (pure HTML, CSS, JS — no backend)

---

## ✨ Features
- **Boot sequence** → immersive startup animation  
- **Command-line interactivity** → try commands like `about`, `skills`, `contact`  
- **Capability Matrix** → a visual "skill bar" of AISLE’s strengths  
- **Selected Work** → live projects ranging from **$600m loan servicing automation**  
  to **custom AI analysts on $100m PE deals**  
- **Contact links** → email, website, and app access

---

## 🚀 Deployment
The site is designed to be **zero-dependency** and can be hosted anywhere:
- **GitHub Pages** (default, subdomain: `terminal.aisle.partners`)
- **Cloudflare Pages**, **Netlify**, or any static hosting  
- Or embedded into `app.aisle.partners` via an `<iframe>`
